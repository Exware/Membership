<h1>Membership Management</h1>

<h2>1. Profiles</h2>

<p>
    1.1 Every user has a user record with generic information such as name, organization, login, a photo, and an email address that the website should use for
    automated communications.
</p>
<p>
    1.2 Every user has a number of additional "meta" fields that hold special profile questions/values such as brand names, and other information specific to your association.
    This data is kept separate from the main user record to make it easier to grow/extend the database without incurring special development or database
    administration costs. However, the system tries to blend these fields into the main profile form so they do not have to be dealt with separately.
</p>
<p>
    1.3 Every user has an account for tracking all of their financial transactions such as purchases and e-commerce payments. (Note that non-users may also
    have accounts, if the website can sell to the general public.)
</p>
<p>
    1.4 Every user has a number of contact records (often called address cards). Users can have multiple contact records for different places (eg. home,
    office). They can also create additional contact records for different levels of privacy (eg. one home address card for administrators only, and another
    home address card for publication on their profile). Note that each contact record can specify additional email addresses for the user, and these may be
    different from the email address that the website uses for automated communications (see 1.1, above). The existence of numerous potential contact records
    makes the system quite flexible, but can cause conceptual complications in reporting. For example, you might want to include a user's address in a report,
    but the user might have several and it may be unclear which one the system should use.
</p>
<p>
    1.5 Secondary members are associated with a primary member record via the "Related to" field in their profile. Secondary members can only relate to
    members. Users who are not secondary contacts should not be related to anyone.
</p>
<p>
    1.6 The member organization and the primary contact share the same user record. The company contact info was imported as the "main" contact for this user,
    and made visible to users. The personal contact info was imported as the "office" contact for this user, and made visible to administrators only.
</p>

<h2>
    2. Editing/Updating User Information
</h2>

<p>
    2.1 Because user data is partitioned into different records, many updating functions are similarly partitioned. For instance, editing contact records is
    separate from editing basic profile information.
</p>
<p>
    2.2 Administrative users will see extra fields in the user profile forms, because of their higher access levels.
</p>
<p>
    2.3 If you delete a user, it will delete all of the information in section 1, including all the secondaries. If you accidentally delete a user, you can
    recover them from the Trash tool. Note that there are ways of hiding/disabling users without deleting them, and sometimes this is a better choice.
</p>
<p>
    2.4 To remove the primary contact from the company, you should replace them with one of the secondaries. Go to the secondary, and promote them to the
    primary spot, which will move the old primary to a secondary spot. Then you have the option of editing/deleting/disabling the former primary. If there are
    no secondaries, then add a secondary with the new contact information, and then promote them.
</p>
<p>
    2.5 To move a user to a different organization, you should edit their basic profile and (1) set their Membership Type to "secondary" and (2) change their
    "Related to" field to the new organization. You may also need to change their "Company/Organization" field. After they have been moved, you then have the
    option of promoting them to become the primary contact.
</p>
<p>
    2.6 Do not attempt to move a primary member to another organization, if they have secondary members, or you will also move those secondaries. Instead, you
    should first promote another secondary, so that the old primary gets demoted. Then it is safe to move the demoted user without bringing everyone else along
    for the ride.
</p>

<h2>
    3. Membership Status
</h2>

<p>
    3.1 The membership status shows their current legal status with the association.
</p>
<p>
    3.2 The status can be manually changed from the Status History screen. This only changes their status setting, and does not perform any other actions that
    might be necessary, such as notifications, activations, etc. To approve membership applications, see 3.3, below.
</p>
<p>
    3.3 If a membership application is pending, you will also see buttons to approve or reject the application. Clicking approve will activate the membership,
    including sending notifications, etc. Clicking reject will undo the application and set the member back to their previous state. It will not refund any
    fees collected, however.
</p>

<h2>
    4. Reports
</h2>
<p>
    4.1 There are two areas to generate reports on your membership.  The roster function in the Membership module allows you to quickly generate
simple reports based on the type and status of your members.  For more advanced reports requiring conditionals (for example, all members
belonging to the north-west chapter of your association who are expiring the next month), use the 'Report Builder for Members' module.
</p>
<p>
    4.2 When generating the roster, you may select an unlimited number of membership types and membership statuses to include by clicking
    on each individually.
</p>
<p>
    4.3 The Roster displays membership information (eg expiry date, status, special meta fields).  Additionally, you may choose to include 
    contact information and/or exclude secondary members by selecting from a list of report options when generating the roster.
